## Scala | Loops(while, do..while, for, nested loops)

Looping in programming languages is a feature which facilitates the execution of a set of instructions/functions
repeatedly while some condition evaluates to true. Scala provides the different types of loop to handle the condition
based situation in the program. The loops in Scala are :

- **while Loop**
- **do..while Loop** -> https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/reference/dropped-features/do-while.html
- **for Loop**
- **Nested Loops**
